# PMO-Dashboard
This system tracks project progress across various business verticals, comparing actual vs. planned costs, revenue, and project stages (Discovery to Operations). It classifies projects by type (A, B, C) and risk (High, Medium, Low), and visualizes key metrics like customer experience, budget, and resource capacity through charts and graphs.
